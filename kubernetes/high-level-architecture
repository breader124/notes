Kubernetes architecture:
	Master nodes architecture: there are 4 components which master nodes are composed of:
		- API server: expose API to the tools that I can use from console, like kubectl
		- Distributed database: stores data about the desired state of the cluster
		- Schedules: schedules pods across the nodes, decides where to launch the new pod
		- Controller manager: ensures that actual cluster state is as desired
	Worker nodes architecture: there are also 4 components which worker nodes are composed of:
		- Node Agent: monitores what is happening on a node and communicates it to master node
		- Networking component: takes care of networking, e.g. exposing services
		- Container runtime: self-eplanatory, in most cases it is docker 
		- PODS: separated component acting as runtime environment for image, applications work here
