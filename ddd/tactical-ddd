value object -- object which value is in importance
entity object -- object which identity is in importance

aggregates: aggregate is a group of entities and value objects that have certain characteristics:
	- aggregate is created, retrieved and stored as a whole
	- aggregate is always in a consistent state
	- aggregate is owned by an entity called the aggregate root, whose ID is used to identify the aggregate itself
	- aggregate can be referenced from the outside through its root only
	- aggregate root is responsible for enforcing business invariants inside the aggregate, keeping consistent state all the time

aggregate design guidelines:
	- keep your aggregates small
	- refer to other aggregates by ID
	- change one aggregate per transaction
	- use optimistic locking

domain events characteristics:
	- they are immutable
	- they have timestamps when the event in question occurred
	- they may have a unique Id that helps to distinguish one event from another
	- they are published by aggregate roots or domain services
